Hello UCB instrutors # VBA-Challenge

I have included separate images for stock price years: 2018, 2019, 2020

I have also included a single VBA .bas file, however, while I can figure out how to run a single script for all worksheets if the variable for number of stock price is constanst, could not run without error and adjusted VBA code to Stock price year 2018, Stock price year 2019, and Stock price year 2020 individually. Would like to know what the ideal solution would be where the variables (Stock) will be different within the current year or over time.
